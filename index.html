        <p>Rosie Banks is in her late twenties, and grew up in a small village in the South West. She spent her childhood dreaming of magical creatures and faraway places, so it was natural that she grew up to write a series of stories where such dreams came true! Rosie has always been close to her two best friends, and their special relationship provided her with inspiration for the magical trio of Jasmine, Ellie and Summer. As a child, Rosie's ultimate ambition was to ride a unicorn. She hasn't managed that yet, but she does have a pony called Flip, and cute puppies called Moony and Max.<br><br>The character was inspired by the prolific early twentieth-century romance novelist Ruby M. Ayres. Wodehouse intentionally chose the name "Rosie M. Banks" to be similar to hers, stating in a 1955 letter to his biographer Richard Usborne that he "wanted a name that would give a Ruby M. Ayres suggestion". Another possible influence is the female novelist Ethel M. Dell (dell/banks = features of countryside scenery), who also has a middle initial of ’M’, a reputation for writing novels of the Rosie M. Banks sort, and is mentioned by name in several Wodehouse stories.<br><br>Rosie M. Banks is a fictional romance novelist. A tall, lissom girl with soft, soulful brown eyes and a nice figure, she is devoted to her pekingese dogs and owns as many as six at a time.She is the author of works such as: All for Love; A Red, Red Summer Rose; Madcap Myrtle; Only a Factory Girl; The Courtship of Lord Strathmorlick; The Woman Who Braved All; Mervyn Keene, Clubman; 'Twas Once in May; By Honour Bound; and A Kiss at Twilight. She also wrote the Christmas story "Tiny Fingers". Jeeves says that one of his aunts owns a complete collection of her works. The books of Rosie M. Banks make "very light, attractive reading", according to Jeeves, and he later says that the scene in Only a Factory Girl in which "Lord Claude takes the girl in his arms" (as described by Bertie Wooster) is one of his aunt's favourite passages. Other fans of her works include Bingo's uncle, Madeline Bassett, and American author Kirk Rockaway (in "Stylish Stouts").</p>
